Navigation Time Tracker will track the time you spend on each visited website. You will be able to determine which ones you want to restrict the use and the limit of time you will be allowed to navigate on them. For example: for every 24 hours, I want to be able to navigate no more than 30 minutes on Facebook. The extension will block the site when you reach those 30 minutes. 

## Installation Instructions

1 - Clone this repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/fberbert/navigation-time-tracker`

Or download and extract the code ZIP.

2 - Open your **Chrome browser** and type in the URL address bar: **chrome://extensions**

3 - Click on the **Load unpacked** button, navigate into the directory of this extension code and confirm.

Job done! **Navigation Timer Tracker** is installed. You can access it through the timer icon in the extensions bar. 

Left-click will open the extension popup, and right-click will let you access the extension options.

I hope you enjoy it.
